## Business Problem
Geospatial data is rich, complex, nuanced, and is integral to many businesses, especially the automotive industry. With its high velocity, complex representations, and time-bound nature, unlocking its full value requires a high performance platform. 

We help organizations to harness real time geospatial, telematics, and sensor data. They ley use cases include road safety, predictive maintenance, infrastructure optimization, and asset/fleet management, all enabled by scalable geospatial analytics.

These geospatial analytics and AI capabilities on Databricks allow companies to achieve improvements up to 30% in fleet efficiency, reduce infrastructure costs by up to 25%, and enable better road safety by decreasing accident rates by up to 20%.
